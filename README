This is the cryptkeyper package.
The current version is 0.0.0.

The package is currently very much work in progress. At the moment,
functionality is limited to one testcase that manages to verify that
the correct AES key is generated when a KeePass file is parsed.

The weakest link in a password manager is, by design, the master password,
which could be stolen by using a keylogger. Other weak points are that many 
times all passwords are exposed in memory when the user opens the password 
database, and that there is little possibility to revoke the password
database if it is compromised, other than manually changing all passwords.

The purpose of cryptkeyper is to make a system that is more resilient to
attacks such as keyloggers and attempts at password database theft.

More details will be added later, but feel free to contact me

project.
